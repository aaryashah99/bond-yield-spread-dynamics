# Bond Yield & Spread Dynamics: Macro-Financial Dashboard Analysis

This Tableau + Excel project explores U.S. bond yield spreads (like 10Y–2Y and 10Y–3M) and their relationship to economic conditions such as inflation, GDP growth, and recessions.

## Project Objective

- Understand the behavior of U.S. Treasury yield spreads over time
- Analyze how spread dynamics signal macroeconomic changes
- Identify potential recession indicators through curve inversions
- Correlate macroeconomic variables with yield movement patterns

---

## Key Dashboards & Analysis Topics

- Yield Curve Over Time (Flattening, Steepening, Inversion)
- 10Y–2Y & 10Y–3M Spread Behavior vs. Inflation and Growth
- Macroeconomic Correlation Matrix
- Tableau heatmaps and trend visualizations
- Economic signals before/during tightening cycles

---

## Tools Used

- **Tableau** – for interactive visualization and dashboard design
- **Excel (XLSX)** – for data structuring, transformation, and matrix prep
- **Git/GitHub** – for version control and public project sharing

---

## Key Insights

- Inverted yield curves (notably 10Y–3M) preceded economic slowdowns in both 2019 and 2022
- Spread tightening aligned with inflation surges and aggressive Fed hikes
- Visual correlation patterns indicate stronger relationships between yield spreads and leading economic indicators than traditional policy rates
